## Disclaimer
If you have been directed here, it is because you absolutely need access to your presets and cannot wait for ReShade shader presets to be updated from GShade.<br><br>
The guide outlined below will allow you to run your presets using GShade. This is **unsupported** and could potentially introduce unwanted behaviour to your FFXIV installation.<br><br>***Use at your own risk***.<br><br> While this has been tested and is proven to work, GShade has been discontinued, and so, over time, this method may no longer work or simply just break your game. You have been warned!
!!!

### Contains:
- Patched `dxgi.dll`, allowing it to be able to run without Marot's ~~shitty~~ DRM
- `GShade` Presets
- `GShade` Shaders that should work.
- Optional addons to replace `FFKeepUI` and `FFRestoreUI`, disabled in here but can be enabled if the user wants.
- `GShade.ini` file containing the locations to the presets, shaders, and addons since the official one had it in Program Files

!!!
### Note
- Screenshots will go to your game installation folder under the folder Screenshots, be sure to change that in the menu.
- Screenshot button is placed in `Shift + Numpad +`, be sure to change that to Print Screen.
- Some shaders can darken your screen if you are using the option addon, this may need to be fixed by the original creator. 
!!!

### Credits
- NotNite for making the patcher tool, getting rid of the malicious check and also removing the DRM. [https://notnite.com/gshade-patcher.html](https://notnite.com/gshade-patcher.html)
- 4lex4nder for making the ReshadeEffectShaderToggler. <br>[https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-FFXIV_UIONLY](https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-FFXIV_UIONLY) 

### Download
Below is the patched shader package for use with GShade. Again, this is **unsupported**. ***Use at your own risk!*** This does not (and will never) contain the GShade Installer because the repository hosting the code is no longer available. Should you use this method, please find a way to install GShade on your own machine before downloading the shaders below.
