# Welcome
If you've landed on this page, you were probably directed from the Shader Porting Project <a href="https://discord.gg/9kQTCB5Xwh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord Server</a>. Welcome \o/

!!!
This Wiki is built with the intention of helping people who are running into issues for migrating from GShade to [ReShade](reshade.me). This is run on a volunteer basis and is by no means a comprehensive guide on *all* the issues that people encounter. Rather, this is meant as a **one-stop shop** for commonly encountered Shader compilation errors, as well as their solution(s) (if any are found).
!!!
## Contributing
Contributions are made on a voluntary basis. Currently, the only person working on the project is me ([CryoTechnic](https://github.com/CryoTechnic))! Should you feel like there is missing information, please do not hesitate to create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Cryotechnic/gshade-migration/pulls) on GitHub to contribute!

### **Disclaimer**
I (and the other people working on this project), are in *no way*, liable for any of the modifications you choose to apply to your shaders. <br><br>By using this knowledgebase, you are actively tinkering with ReShade shaders, which could produce undesired behaviour on how your game looks as well as how it performs.<br><br>**This is by no means a definitive guide** and is subject to change. We are all passionate about this project and do our best to keep it up-to-date, but at the end of the day, ***we have lives too***. Please don't harass or spam anyone to add a feature just because you feel entitled to it :))
!!!
## Sections
This knowledgebase will ideally contain, in the not-so-distant future, by-preset sections, allowing users to easily navigate through all the pages by searching for Tags or keywords inside a given page.

## GShade Compatibility

### **USE THIS IF YOU REALLY NEED SOME OF YOUR PRESETS TO LOOK AS BEFORE UNTIL THEY GET UPDATED**
The guide linked below will allow you to run your presets using GShade. This is **unsupported** and could potentially introduce unwanted behaviour to your FFXIV installation. ***Use at your own risk***. While this has been tested and is proven to work, GShade has been discontinued, and so, over time, this method may no longer work or simply just break your game. You have been warned!
