# Welcome
If you've landed on this page, you were probably directed from the Shader Porting Project [Discord Server](). Welcome \o/

!!!
This Wiki is built with the intention of helping people who are running into issues for migrating from GShade to [ReShade](reshade.me). This is run on a volunteer basis and is by no means a comprehensive guide on *all* the issues that people encounter. Rather, this is meant as a **one-stop shop** for commonly encountered Shader compilation errors, as well as their solution(s) (if any are found).
!!!
